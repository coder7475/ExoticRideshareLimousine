    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p class="lead">

            Cookstown at the south-west extremity of the township, became an incorporated village in 1962, with 100 acres of
            Innisfil becoming part of Cookstown. In 1967, 597 acres were annexed from Innisfil by the City of Barrie to accommodate
            the establishment of the Formosa Spring Brewery. This facility was purchased by Molson's and has since been closed and
            sub-let to other businesses.
            
            Cookstown is a hub of antique specialty stores and outlet shopping, and is known as the antique capital of southern
            Ontario. Cookstown is also known for its annual garage sale called "Wing-Ding" which occurs the first weekend of June
            every year. The Cookstown Fair is held annually, usually in September. Cookstown is the birthplace of Emily Murphy, a
            noted Canadian women's rights activist. In 1916, she became the first woman police magistrate in Alberta, and in the
            British Empire. She is best known for her contributions to Canadian feminism, specifically to the question of whether
            women were "persons" under Canadian law.
