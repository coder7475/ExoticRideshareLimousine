    </div>

        <p class="lead">

Brougham  is a community within the northern part of the City of Pickering, in Durham Region of
Ontario, Canada. Some of its lands are affected by plans to build the proposed Pickering Airport. There are concerns
because some of its buildings are of architectural significance.There is one bus in the area; the 52
York University passes through with a stop at Brock Road. The children go
to school at Valley View Public School in its neighbouring town of Greenwood. It has slowly reduced in population and
business as the 407 wound its way through in the early 2000s. It currently houses an Antique Restoration, Pickering
Animal Shelter, Hot Tub Outlet and RV dealership, as well as a handful of historical buildings dating back to the
Mackenzie Rebellion. In the past, the hamlet has been home for a Mac's Milk (Formerly Beckers) as well as a Family Run
Hardware Store, a small restaurant as well as a small mechanic shop, most of which closed down in or around the time
that the plans for the 407 development came to realization.
