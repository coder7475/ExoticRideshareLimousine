        <p class="lead">

            Bramalea is a city in Southern Ontario, Canada. It is a suburban city in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and
        Brockville is a city in Eastern Ontario, Canada, in the Thousand Islands region. Though it serves as the seat of the
        United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, Brockville is politically independent and is grouped with Leeds and Grenville
        for census purposes only. Known as the "City of the 1000 Islands", Brockville is located on the north shore of the St.
        Lawrence River, directly opposite Morristown, New York, about half-way between Cornwall in the east and Kingston in the
        west, and roughly a 40-minute drive to the national capital of Ottawa. It is one of Ontario's oldest urban centres, and
        is named after the British general Sir Isaac Brock.
        
        Brockville is host to countless festivals, events and fun activities. Celtic Festival, Buskers, Riverfest, Ribfest,
        Automotion, and 1000 Islands Poker Run attract over four hundred thousand people to the region. "Part of the charm of
        the area is that you can live in the country but work in the city and be all of twenty minutes apart!" Discover the
        spell of the mighty St. Lawrence River. Be our guest...you may never want to leave!
