    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p class="lead">
            King City is an affluent, unincorporated village in King Township, Ontario, Canada, located just north of Toronto. It is
            the largest community in King Township, with 1,629 dwellings and a population of 4,902. Originally a small settlement
            styled Springhill, King City has slowly grown since the arrival of the railway in 1853. King City is characterized by
            rolling hills and clustered temperate forests. Numerous kettle lakes and ponds dot the area. Creeks and streams from
            this region are the origin for the East Humber River (as are the streams from as far west as Bolton and as far east as
            Stouffville).
            
            Situated on the southern slope of the central portion of the sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine and located just north of the
            City of Vaughan and Toronto is King City, a community of approximatley 5,000 residents. King City is characterized by
            rolling hills and clustered temperate forests and also home to international, corporate and small businesses.
