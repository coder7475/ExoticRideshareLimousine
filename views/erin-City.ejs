    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p class="lead">

            Erin is a town in Wellington County, approximately 80 kilometres northwest of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Erin is an
            amalgamated town, composed of the former Villages of Erin and Hillsburgh, and the hamlets of Ballinafad, Brisbane, Cedar
            Valley, Crewson's Corners, and Orton, as well as the former Township of Erin. Erin is primarily a rural community but,
            while farming is still an important activity in the town, most of its population works in the nearby cities of Brampton,
            Mississauga, Guelph, and even Toronto.
            
            The Town of Erin is an amalgamated community of 11,830 people in 3,900 households, situated in Wellington County, just
            northwest of Toronto. We have two urban centres, Erin and Hillsburgh, surrounded by a natural rural area which includes
            six hamlets: Ballinafad, Brisbane, Cedar Valley, Crewson's Corners, Orton and Ospringe. We are bordered by the Town of
            Caledon to the east, the Town of Halton Hills to the south, the Township of Guelph/Eramosa to the west and the Township
            of East Garafraxa to the north.
