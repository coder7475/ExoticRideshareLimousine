    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p class="lead">
            Kingston is a Canadian city located in Eastern Ontario where the St. Lawrence River flows out of Lake Ontario. In order
            to control the fur trade, French explorer LaSalle founded Fort Frontenac in 1673. Located midway between Toronto and
            Montreal, Kingston was named the first capital of the Province of Canada on February 15, 1841, by Governor Lord
            Sydenham. While its time as a political centre was short, Kingston remained an important military installation. Kingston
            is the county seat of Frontenac County. Kingston is nicknamed the "Limestone City" because of the many historic
            buildings built from the local limestone.
            
            Renowned as the fresh-water capital of North America, Kingston is a major port to cruise the famous Thousand Islands.
            Every August the city is a hub of activity when hundreds of sailors converge for CORK, the annual Canadian Olympic
            Training Regatta. Steeped in history and tradition, Kingston is the resting-place of Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's
            first Prime Minister. History buffs can visit Fort Henry, a 19th century British Military Fortress, or one of the
            seventeen museums that showcase everything from woodworking tools to military and technological advances.
